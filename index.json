The Forer effect refers to the tendency of people to rate sets of statements as highly accurate for them personally even though the statements could apply to many people. Goal Show students the importance of specific vs vague statements, demonstrate why horoscopes and psychics work and why people tend to believe in these seemingly random encounters.\n IRB Review   Students are given a filled in IRB which they go over thoroughly and then they are given a bad IRB and asked to \u0026ldquo;fix it\u0026rdquo;. Goal Structure Schedule Discussion Followup  Movie nights  Goal This is to\n Observation of TV  Select a TV show to watch about 15 minutes of. It should be something fairly interesting, even funny. Ask students, what might be some interesting topics to investigate and to look for and then run a structured/natural observation. Goal Practicing observation Structure Have\n Psychological mythbusters  How psychological knowledge is constructed and how it is constructed wrong\n Sampling poker chips  Examples of sampling procedures and how they can give us biased results\n Science or pseudoscience  This activity let\u0026rsquo;s students to pick a pseudoscientific or \u0026ldquo;junk\u0026rdquo; science topic, present to the class what it is and why it is junk science. Goal Distinguish between real sciences and pseudo sciences. Be clear that \u0026ldquo;unreal\u0026rdquo; things are not necessarily not scientific - what makes atoms more believable than ghosts to a general public without an electron microscope? Neither can be touched, neither can be seen. List of topics Animal magnetism Graphology Fortune telling Rorschach test Neurolinguistic programming MBTI test Ouija board Telepathy Faith healing Telekinesis Čištění 12.\n Uncovering fake artist  Synesthesia is not an unknown or entirely uncommon thing, but still. If an artist claims she sells paintings of what she hears, you\u0026rsquo;d better be certain before you buy it and start boasting to your friends. Goal Design an experiment to prove synesthesia in an artist who claims so. Try approach it from different levels of anlaysis - bio vs cognitive. Practicing good hypothesis formulation. How to create hypothesis from theory.\n What is psychology  Short introduction to preexisting ideas about psychology\n What is science?  Definition of what is science and what is not\n Zodiac signs and personality  Are zodiac personality types correct\n "

Biologists can measure protein quantities, physicists can measure time it takes for a pendulum to swing, but we never directly measure memory. We usually say we measure intelligence, friendliness, happiness, but we don\u0026rsquo;t. We construct the term of happiness and then we devise a method to measure it. So it can be biased, it can be wrong, it can be challenged. But that is OK :)\nWhereas definition talks about what a thing like happiness is, operationalisation speaks of a process of actually measuring it. It derives from the definition. If we say that happy are those who have money, then operationalisation of happiness is the quantity of money. If we define intelligence as an ability to solve tasks, we create a tests which ask people to solve tasks which we consider that \u0026ldquo;intelligent\u0026rdquo; people should solve. But mistakes can happen.\nOld intelligence tests for example tackled a lot of mathematical thinking or memory, completely ignoring verbal or spatial skills. Some tests of memory asked people to remember numbers, ignoring that some people are rubbish at remembering numbers but they can remember thousands of faces and names. How we define and how we operationalise our terms will define if our research is valid.\nMeasures of good science Research is not\nValidity Types of validity\nReliability Unreliable test is always also not valid. Even seemingly \u0026ldquo;unreliable\u0026rdquo; results which are consistent with the prediction are considered reliable - e.g. tests for immediate stress levels are reliable when tested in the same conditions.\nTypes of reliability Test-retest\nInter-rater reliability\nResearch design Extraneous variables Demand characteristics\nBlind and double blind study\n"

	"content": " Sampling is a process of selecting part of target population to be studied. In an optimal world, we would measure everybody. Measuring everybody would allow us to perfectly describe the population and get to something called \u0026ldquo;True mean\u0026rdquo;. If we get everybody\u0026rsquo;s height, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to run statistics. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; for group differences, we can be certain about our assertions regardless of statistics.\nBut we are not in an wishful and perfect world adn we only can measure a fixed amout of people - only a hundred inhabitants of France. How then we pick those that perfectly represent the entire population of France? Entire population of Young adults?Entire population of home schooled children?\nTerminology  Population: Our target group. In cognitive psychology this is often \u0026ldquo;everybody\u0026rdquo; as we are interested in how memory, perception works regardless of cultural or social background. In social psych it can be only those people from a particular social background ora culture, in abnormal psychology it can be only people suffering from a particular disease. In some cases (e.g Being sane in insane places) we may be actually interested in \u0026ldquo;hospitals\u0026rdquo;, or agencies or groups of individuals rather than people. Sampling: Procedure of selecting individuals form our population into our sample. Sample: The final sample of people we ended up with.     Research question Population Ideal practical sample Real sample     How many faces can human memory store? Everybody 200 random people from around the world 60 people from PSYCH 101 class   Is the new antipsychotic drug better than the previous one? All patients on the previous drug/all patients 100 random patients from countries where the drug is going to be sold 15 patients from John Hopkins or any other hospital willing to participate   Do the new contraception pills affect cognitive skills? All women on contraceptives 200 random women on contraceptives 30 women who visit gynaecologist who is being paid to do the study   How do babies interact with their peers? All babies between 0 to 3 years 50 observations in different situations and settings 10 observations done in a kindergarten close to the research lab    Sampling bias Sampling bias = not selecting a sample representative of the population\nTime, money and personnel troubles arise in random samples, biases in nonprobability samples\nIt is not clearly stated why a sample was selected in this way\nThe research conclusion does not reflect sampling bias –Research claims that all students are lazy, but only tested students in two classes in three high schools in Virginia\n##Sampling process\n Define research question: English language acquisition in adults Define concerned population: 18-65 non-native English speakers : Define resources available:money, time, personnel Determine sampling method: opportunity sampling – English course taught at the university for foreign PhD students Do the sampling Do the research Evaluate Do it again  Sampling methods Probability methods\nNon probability methods\nRandom sampling Every person in target population has an equal chance of ending in the sample. Usually done by making a list of all the people in the population and then randomly selecting N names.\n   Pros Cons     Statistically the best solution, Least troubles defending it before other scientists Where do you get the list of people to randomize from?, Nearly impossible in most cases, Time and money issues, Large decay of sample (just selecting people does not mean they will participate), Not necessarily the best in all cases, People usually refuse or they feel their anonymity was breached (where did you get my contact??)    Cluster Sampling Rather than selecting each individual in target population, we focus on clusters where these people occur in larger groups (workplace, school, clubs etc.). Every group then has an equal chance of ending in a sample. Therefore we select a four football clubs and text all their members (N = 110), rather than selecting 110 players from across the country.\n   Pros Cons     Much cheaper, Fast – people come to clubs/schools on their own volition, Focused groups Very biased (we can select the best group or the worst), The bias is usually multiplied by the number of people in the cluster (30 bright students, vs 30 average students), Needs permission of the entire club/class/school    Stratified sampling Selecting random sample from within subgroups defined by the research aim. You want to draw a stratified sample of 50 children from a school containing 75% girls and 25% boys-\u0026gt; girls need to be three times as likely to be in the sample.\n   Pros Cons     Very targeted and focused on the question, Allows for smaller samples while maintaining validity and statistical power, Allows for controlling of extraneous variables You need to know the subgroups and extraneous variables before the research takes place, sometimes this is not achievable, it is easier than to just give people questionnaire and control for variables using statistics    Opportunity sampling People simply apply to participate in the research for university credit, money or just out of curiosity. Or researchers ask friends, relatives etc. They usually need to meet certain criteria (e.g. males 25-36 in a relationship; students of visual arts; people working in an international company etc.)\n   Pros Cons     Fast and convenient, People usually come to you, Universities promote research, Sometimes it just doesn’t matter, who participates, so why make it hard? Extremely biased in most cases, Cannot be easily generalised to population, Somewhat unethical    Sampling vs controlling Sampling is a process of selecting people from target population Controlling is a process of eliminating extraneous variables\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " All research needs to abide any law in a country where it is conducted, but that is often not enough to make sure that participants are treated with dignity and respect. Until ethics in psychological research has been \u0026ldquo;established\u0026rdquo; and certain rules codified, researchers often conducted studies which might have had lasting implications on their participants without necessary precautions being made. For that reason, certain (legally still not forcable) rules were introduced and ethical review processes established.\nNeedless to say,\nBelmont report National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the 1978 issues a report on proper behavioural and biomedicinal research.\nThe three fundamental ethical principles for using any human subjects for research are:\n Respect for persons: protecting the autonomy of all people and treating them with courtesy and respect and allowing for informed consent. Researchers must be truthful and conduct no deception; Beneficence: The philosophy of \u0026ldquo;Do no harm\u0026rdquo; while maximizing benefits for the research project and minimizing risks to the research subjects; and Justice: ensuring reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedures are administered fairly — the fair distribution of costs and benefits to potential research participants — and equally.  That is being put into practice through\n Informed consent Assessment of Risk and Benefits Selection of Subjects  While scientist\u0026rsquo;s curiosity is a good reason to conduct a research, it is not a completely good reason to take away time from people. Thus any study requiring participation from human subjects should assess it\u0026rsquo;s benefits to justify the means. As far as a concrete specific practices, there are certain rights each participant has and which should be followed:\n Right to know about the purpose of the study (informed consent, debriefing, results sharing) Right for fair treatment (right to quit the study at any point) Right to remain anonymous  IRB reveiw Institutional Review Board serves as a corrector of possible malpractices spiralling in any given institution. Although not always required by law, IRBs are a necessary element of a research institution to make sure that research is not only abiding by the law, but also by the Human Rights or the rules established by the Belmont report.\nIRB is presented with a full documentation of a research proposal, including but not limited to:\n topic and purpose of the study research design and procedure type of data to be collected (what type of personal data are you collecting, are you collecting any personal identificators) location of data storage (where will you keep the data and how will you assure anonymity, how will you make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t lose it?) description of a population (who will be in the sample and why) sampling procedure (how will you sample and why) informed consent (what is in and how to obtain) risks and benefits for participants (debriefing)  appendices usually include:\n list of responsible personal who will interact with participants informed consent recruitment adds, flyers etc. any research material (such as images, questionnaires)  Some elements which IRB review will discuss include\n Assessment if the study can\u0026rsquo;t be done in another way - if participants are lied to, is there really no other way where that is not possible? Does it need to take 8 hours? Assessment is the study is worth it - if the benefits for the field are not significant, it might not get a pass (problems for replication studies) Assessment if the research is just - it benefits all people the same, not only a certain minority Assessment of research sample and possible misuse of power relationship - special protection of minorities, such as prisoners, children etc. Using prisoners for a prison related research is fine, selecting them for a study of visual acuity is probably bordering misuse of power. Assessment of conflict of interest  Types of IRB review There are generally three types of IRB review process.\n Exempt - no review necessary (you still submit all the materials, but ask for an exempt based) Expedited - fast review for studies posing no more than minimal risk for the subject Full - full board review, usually for studies involving children, minorities or posing more than minimal risk  Which category falls on your research is based on specific criteria at a particular institution, but some rules are generally the same across the board:\nExempt from IRB review is research:\n with non identifiable subjects using existing and publicly available information research in educational settings for the immediate benefit which will not lead to identification of individuals research or demonstration for public benefit food liking research in shopping malls :)  Expedited IRB review will be available for research:\n posing no more than minimal risk where identification of participants would not place them at risk which is not classified  Other ethical issues The ethical questions do not end with the study being over. Researchers are still responsible for the data to remain anonymous, but in some case also for the data \u0026ldquo;not to get lost\u0026rdquo; or not to get to the wrong hands. Researchers are also responsible for the correct interpretation of their results which is in concordance with the assessment of benefits - e.g. if the study was about visual acuity but the data is eventually used to asses racial differences based on the visual processing, that should require a new IRB review.\nCorrect reporting of results is also in accordance with the first rule of the Belomont report. The participants gave us their time and we should respect their decision and use their contribution in a meaningul manner. In that sense, not publishing collected data is sometimes also considered unethical, although there is a battle between not publishing collected data and publishing misinterpreted research results (as you never know, what data will you get).\n  Attachments   describe-etical-issues.pdf  (35 ko)   discussing-ethical-issues.pdf  (49 ko)   ethics-case-examples.pdf  (77 ko)   ethics-terminology.pdf  (20 ko)   sample-informed-consent-stanford.docx  (24 ko)   sample-irb-san-siego.doc  (427 ko)   stamford-exempt-irb.pdf  (55 ko)   stamford-expedited-irb.pdf  (52 ko)   the-belmont-report.pdf  (120 ko)   truly-unethical-research.docx  (13 ko)   yale-irb-requirement.pdf  (23 ko)    "

Students get an instruction to walk freely and follow others, with a small percentage of them getting clear instructions of what to do - walk towards a basketball court, walk towards a door.\nGoal Students learn that if everybody is somewhat aimless and without a particular agenda, few individuals can actually instruct majority in accepting their views, if that is done subversly.\nStructure Print out the sheet and cut the instructions so that you have about 5 percent of instructions with a clear goal. Checkout the place where you can do this activity - gym outside court. You hsould have a fairly alrge place available. Not down the important place (door, statue, window) to which you will direct your chosen 5 percent.\nFinish the instructions so that the specifically say where to go. GO outside, give year student instructions at random. Explain how to walk slowly and how exactly to follow the common instructions. Spread each person around the court so that they are fairly away from each other. Start the thing :)\nDiscussion  Hwo to relate results to real world - politics, social movements?

It\u0026rsquo;s goal isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily for the student to understand everything in the text, but to be able to pinpoint important parts and to discuss valid points the article makes.\nThe activity follows classes on research. Students are given each question immediately after appropriate lesson has been covered (e.g. question 10 after ethics have been gone through). In the end, students hand out a summary of a scientific paper.\nGoal Teaching students how to read research which might be a bit over their heads with its complexity. Showing the plethora of methodologies used. Showing the structure that scientific articles usually have (IMRD). Learning to think critically about conducted research - was it done well? Does it actually answer the question it set to answer?\nStructure Let students select a paper from a list of approved studies. Read through one paper together in class and answer all questions - even those which they don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are - sometimes, some students do :)\nLet them \u0026ldquo;browse\u0026rdquo; the paper and answer questions 1-4. Then, after each lesson on a particular topic (say methods, ethics, statistics), give them those questions to answer as well. After all questions have been answered (usually 3-4 weeks) ,give them extra week to finalize the report.\nSchedule in points  Go over one psych paper together (procrastionation by Dan Ariely)\n Read the article and Answer questions 1-4 - even though they don’t know perfectly how or they don\u0026rsquo;t understand the entire paper\n Get their answers and give brief pointers. Do not mark at this point\n Get back to each question as you do each appropriate section (sampling, ethics) and ask them to hand you answer to those questions as you cover the lessons.\n After all questions have been answered, give them one week to \u0026ldquo;finalize\u0026rdquo; the report.\n Get their new answers (and mark them).\n  Questions  What was the purpose of the study\n What was the hypothesis?\n What was the conclusion?\n What did the authors say that can be a problem with their conclusion?\n What was the method used for the research? Describe it.\n If the research had independent and dependent variables, describe what they were and how they were operationalised.\n Can the results be generalized to bigger sample? To which one and which one not?\n Does the research seem valid? (Or does it strike you as weird, too laboratory, not well designed, unusable etc.). What problems did you have with the method?\n Was the method well chosen for the problem? Can you think of a better one?\n Was the study ethical? Explain.\n Concluding remarks.

	"content": " This activity is a good introduction to a scientific inquiry as well as discussion in the psychology vs parapsychology introduction. The Forer effect refers to the tendency of people to rate sets of statements as highly accurate for them personally even though the statements could apply to many people.\nGoal Show students the importance of specific vs vague statements, demonstrate why horoscopes and psychics work and why people tend to believe in these seemingly random encounters. Introduce research in psychology testing and creation of psychological assessment.\nStructure Give students a questionaire to fill. The questionnaire should be irrelevant to the personality profile but still seem to be psychological - similarly to zodiac signs.\nExamples of questions are: - How often do you eat chicken meat? - How often do you follow weather forecast? - Which geometric shape you like the best? - What is your favorite colour?\nAfter students have filled in the questionnaire, create their personality profiles. The more \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; they look, the bigger the effect - tehoretically :) Each one is the same with the same Barnum statements. Stress out that they should not share it at this moment with their peers.\nHave them \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; each statement as \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, or neither. And then let them mark the final profile.\nAfter they return the profile, start a discussion\nAfter they hand you in their results, you can do the Which desert are you activity (in files). And then followup with the discussion.\n Statements  You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others\u0026rsquo; statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life.  Discussion Before the discussion, give students the option to \u0026ldquo;guess\u0026rdquo; what this activity tried to accomplish. Then tell them about the statemtns and that everybody got the same thing. Discussion topics\n Why did you / didn\u0026rsquo;t you think it described you well? Which statements do you think everybody agreed with? What is the \u0026ldquo;danger\u0026rdquo; of this process? How it can relate to psychology and \u0026ldquo;endanger\u0026rdquo; it? What is the important message to take away?  Follow up It is a good idea to analyse their results and potentially pinpoint those questions in which most people answered true/false.\nasdf\n   Attachments   profile-result.pdf  (32 ko)   vague-statements-activity.PDF  (97 ko)   which-desert-are-you.pdf  (57 ko)    "

	"content": " Interesting Bits of Psychological science I started this website to store all activities that I use during my lessons as well as to provide activities to teach IB Psychology - Free of charge. IB is cool and I believe it\u0026rsquo;s goals are noble, yet the lack of support for their curriculum and charging people for everything, only providing licenses to those who pay etc. etc. goes against anything I believe open science and open education is. So this website allows you to have an alternative to paid resources and to provide guides for those who wanna teach or learn but don\u0026rsquo;t want to or can\u0026rsquo;t burn hundreds of dollars.\nWho is doing this? I am teaching psychology at NOVÝ PORG in Prague, but only as a side job. I am a scientist at National Institute of Mental Health and Czech Academy of Sciences, focusing on VR, technologies and their psychological, behavioural and neural correlates. I have a bit of experience with teaching (IB) Psychology for few years, and I have experience with studying psychology and neurosciences from both Prague, Canada (McGill University) and the US (University of California, Davis).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t consider what I write here as a necessary way to progress through the curriculum, but as a guideline that suits me and mine scientific background. You might find that I list things that IB either doesn\u0026rsquo;t do at all or isn\u0026rsquo;t keen on, but that is just my approach as a person, who has been doing psychology and psychological science for the past 10 years.\nHelping things grow If you have activities or you have suggestions to this website, please email me or better, follow instructions here.\nIf somebody wanna help with design or maintenance, I\u0026rsquo;d appreciate it as well.\n"

The good chip numebrs to choose can be either normal chip denominations, or better to tie it to another psychological scale, such as Extraversion T-score, or memory span etc.\nCreate several \u0026ldquo;groups\u0026rdquo; of 7 chips which will have different expected average value but with different \u0026ldquo;variables\u0026rdquo;. The values below are from a range of 1-10 with different average expectation in each group and expectation of 5.4 overall.\n   Group Description Average value Values     Normal Normal population with a normal non extreme spread 5 3,3,4,5,6,7,7   Normal shifted Normal population with the same SD, but mean is 7 7 5,5,6,7,8,9,9   Extremes the sample has average the same as normal group but with many extremes 5 0,0,2,5,8,10,10   Bias side Sample has only few extremes but oly on a single side  0,0,4,5,6,7,7   Unreliable Has same numbers as normal population, but some values are missing  3,missing,4,5,missing,7,missing    To demonstrate opportunistic sampling, explain that each bag is a school of kids and have each group sample only that, which is closes to them.\n Task Between group comparisons  Select two chips from each group and report average. Select three chips and report average. Select 5 chips from each bag and report average.  Population description  You can only select 10 in total. What is the average of the entire population.

Where does good and bad science differ?\nWhat makes good science? 1) Science follows rules and guidelines - appropriate at a certain point in scientific knowledge. When we know certain method is invalid, science stops using it. (Scientology )\n2) Science values facts vs opinions - fact is a piece of information that multiple people agree on?

	"description": "Are zodiac personality types correct",
	"content": " Personality profiles derived from star placements during the time of one\u0026rsquo;s birth are a thorn in a foot of many psychologists. But is there a reason?\nOne of the old principles say, that if a theory survives for a long time, there must be some validity in it. So how is it with zodiac signs?\nThis activity can be preceded by the Forer effect activity\n Goal Investigate validity of zodiac personality profiles. Students learn how to operationalize and structure their investigation. How to actually \u0026ldquo;define\u0026rdquo; the zodiac signs, how to assess the correct approach, how to analyse collected data.\nStudents learn that such approach isn\u0026rsquo;t different from other psychological tests. In the end, we discuss why zodiac signs might have survived such a long time.\nStructure Students in groups are asked to \u0026ldquo;Validate zodiac sign personality types\u0026rdquo;. The first step will be to actually define those traits. After definitions are established, they are asked to devise a plan to actually test it. Several approaches are viable - either testing for traits and then devising zodiac sign from those (but that is not how it actually works and it is not what we want to test!!!). So the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; approach is to be able to append correct personality type to a correct zodiac sign - therefore person born as Leo, should be classified as such.\nAfter the method is determined, start collecting data. Note the importance of \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;double blind\u0026rdquo; study in this case. Also talk about importnace of big samples.\nAfter the data is collected, students can provide it to the teacher who will analyse it appropriately (probably chi-squared tests or fisher exact test). Talk again about the importance of large samples.\nYou can even try and debate meta analysis - combining results from few different groups.\nFinish with the discussion about the results.\n Why did you obtain these results? Do you think your results invalidate the thousands years of knowledge? Why this theory \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; for a long time.  Schedule  Define zodiac types - with the use of internet, books etc. Try to enforce multiple sources. Determine appropriate method to test if the sign \u0026ldquo;fits\u0026rdquo;. Collect the data. Talk about the importance of sampling and blind study. Analyse the results. Discuss the results and perserverance of invalid theories  Links Astrology\n"
