It\u0026rsquo;s goal isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily for the student to understand everything in the text, but to be able to pinpoint important parts and to discuss valid points the article makes.\nThe activity follows classes on research. Students are given each question immediately after appropriate lesson has been covered (e.g. question 10 after ethics have been gone through). In the end, students hand out a summary of a scientific paper.\nGoal Teaching students how to read research which might be a bit over their heads with its complexity. Showing the plethora of methodologies used. Showing the structure that scientific articles usually have (IMRD). Learning to think critically about conducted research - was it done well? Does it actually answer the question it set to answer?\nStructure Let students select a paper from a list of approved studies. Read through one paper together in class and answer all questions - even those which they don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are - sometimes, some students do :)\nLet them \u0026ldquo;browse\u0026rdquo; the paper and answer questions 1-4. Then, after each lesson on a particular topic (say methods, ethics, statistics), give them those questions to answer as well. After all questions have been answered (usually 3-4 weeks) ,give them extra week to finalize the report.\nSchedule in points  Go over one psych paper together (procrastionation by Dan Ariely)\n Read the article and Answer questions 1-4 - even though they don’t know perfectly how or they don\u0026rsquo;t understand the entire paper\n Get their answers and give brief pointers. Do not mark at this point\n Get back to each question as you do each appropriate section (sampling, ethics) and ask them to hand you answer to those questions as you cover the lessons.\n After all questions have been answered, give them one week to \u0026ldquo;finalize\u0026rdquo; the report.\n Get their new answers (and mark them).\n  Questions  What was the purpose of the study\n What was the hypothesis?\n What was the conclusion?\n What did the authors say that can be a problem with their conclusion?\n What was the method used for the research? Describe it.\n If the research had independent and dependent variables, describe what they were and how they were operationalised.\n Can the results be generalized to bigger sample? To which one and which one not?\n Does the research seem valid? (Or does it strike you as weird, too laboratory, not well designed, unusable etc.). What problems did you have with the method?\n Was the method well chosen for the problem? Can you think of a better one?\n Was the study ethical? Explain.\n Concluding remarks.

	"content": " This activity is a good introduction to a scientific inquiry as well as discussion in the psychology vs parapsychology introduction. The Forer effect refers to the tendency of people to rate sets of statements as highly accurate for them personally even though the statements could apply to many people.\nGoal Show students the importance of specific vs vague statements, demonstrate why horoscopes and psychics work and why people tend to believe in these seemingly random encounters. Introduce research in psychology testing and creation of psychological assessment.\nStructure Give students a questionaire to fill. The questionnaire should be irrelevant to the personality profile but still seem to be psychological - similarly to zodiac signs.\nExamples of questions are: - How often do you eat chicken meat? - How often do you follow weather forecast? - Which geometric shape you like the best? - What is your favorite colour?\nAfter students have filled in the questionnaire, create their personality profiles. The more \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; they look, the bigger the effect - tehoretically :) Each one is the same with the same Barnum statements. Stress out that they should not share it at this moment with their peers.\nHave them \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; each statement as \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, or neither. And then let them mark the final profile.\nAfter they return the profile, start a discussion\nAfter they hand you in their results, you can do the Which desert are you activity (in files). And then followup with the discussion.\n\rStatements  You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others\u0026rsquo; statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life.  Discussion Before the discussion, give students the option to \u0026ldquo;guess\u0026rdquo; what this activity tried to accomplish. Then tell them about the statemtns and that everybody got the same thing. Discussion topics\n Why did you / didn\u0026rsquo;t you think it described you well? Which statements do you think everybody agreed with? What is the \u0026ldquo;danger\u0026rdquo; of this process? How it can relate to psychology and \u0026ldquo;endanger\u0026rdquo; it? What is the important message to take away?  Follow up It is a good idea to analyse their results and potentially pinpoint those questions in which most people answered true/false.\nasdf\n\rOnline resources  Wiki page\n Forer effect on Skeptic\n Barnum statements\n  \r\rAttachments\r\r\rprofile-result.pdf\r\r(32 ko)\r\r\rvague-statements-activity.pdf\r\r(97 ko)\r\r\rwhich-desert-are-you.pdf\r\r(57 ko)\r\r\r\r"

	"content": " Personality profiles derived from star placements during the time of one\u0026rsquo;s birth are a thorn in a foot of many psychologists. But is there a reason?\nOne of the old principles say, that if a theory survives for a long time, there must be some validity in it. So how is it with zodiac signs?\nThis activity can be preceded by the Forer effect activity\n\rGoal Investigate validity of zodiac personality profiles. Students learn how to operationalize and structure their investigation. How to actually \u0026ldquo;define\u0026rdquo; the zodiac signs, how to assess the correct approach, how to analyse collected data.\nStudents learn that such approach isn\u0026rsquo;t different from other psychological tests. In the end, we discuss why zodiac signs might have survived such a long time.\nStructure Students in groups are asked to \u0026ldquo;Validate zodiac sign personality types\u0026rdquo;. The first step will be to actually define those traits. After definitions are established, they are asked to devise a plan to actually test it. Several approaches are viable - either testing for traits and then devising zodiac sign from those (but that is not how it actually works and it is not what we want to test!!!). So the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; approach is to be able to append correct personality type to a correct zodiac sign - therefore person born as Leo, should be classified as such.\nAfter the method is determined, start collecting data. Note the importance of \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;double blind\u0026rdquo; study in this case. Also talk about importnace of big samples.\nAfter the data is collected, students can provide it to the teacher who will analyse it appropriately (probably chi-squared tests or fisher exact test). Talk again about the importance of large samples.\nYou can even try and debate meta analysis - combining results from few different groups.\nFinish with the discussion about the results.\n Why did you obtain these results? Do you think your results invalidate the thousands years of knowledge? Why this theory \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; for a long time.  Schedule  Define zodiac types - with the use of internet, books etc. Try to enforce multiple sources. Determine appropriate method to test if the sign \u0026ldquo;fits\u0026rdquo;. Collect the data. Talk about the importance of sampling and blind study. Analyse the results. Discuss the results and perserverance of invalid theories  Links Astrology\n"
