All research needs to abide any law in a country where it is conducted, but that is often not enough to make sure that participants are treated with dignity and respect. Until ethics in psychological research has been "established" and certain rules codified, researchers often conducted studies which might have had lasting implications on their participants without necessary precautions being made. For that reason, certain (legally still not forcable) rules were introduced and ethical review processes established.

Needless to say, 

## Belmont report

National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the 1978 issues a report on proper behavioural and biomedicinal research.  

The three fundamental ethical principles for using any human subjects for research are:[2]

1. Respect for persons: protecting the autonomy of all people and treating them with courtesy and respect and allowing for informed consent. Researchers must be truthful and conduct no deception;
2. Beneficence: The philosophy of "Do no harm" while maximizing benefits for the research project and minimizing risks to the research subjects; and
3. Justice: ensuring reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedures are administered fairly — the fair distribution of costs and benefits to potential research participants — and equally.

That is being put into practice through

1. Informed consent
2. Assessment of Risk and Benefits
3. Selection of Subjects

While scientist's curiosity is a good reason to conduct a research, it is not a completely good reason to take away time from people. Thus any study requiring participation from human subjects should assess it's benefits to justify the means.
As far as a concrete specific practices, there are certain rights each participant has and which should be folowed:

1. Right to know about the purpose of the study (informed consent, debriefing, results sharing)
2. Right for fair treatment (right to quit the study at any point)
3. Right to remain anonymous

## IRB reveiw
Internal Review Board serves as a corrector of possible malpractices spiralling in any given institution. Although not always required by law, IRBs are a necessary element of a research institution to make sure that research is not only abiding by the law, but also by the Human Rights or the rules established by the Belmont report.

IRB is presented with a full documentation of a research proposal, including but not limited to:

- topic and purpose of the study 
- research design and procedure
- type of data to be collected (what type of personal data are you collecting, are you collecting any personal identificators)
- location of data storage (where will you keep the data and how will you assure anonymity)
- description of a population (who will be in the sample and why)
- sampling procedure (how will you sample and why)
- informed consent (what is in and how to obtain)
- risks and benefits for participants (debriefing)

appendices usually include:

- list of responsible personal who will interact with participants
- informed consent
- recruitment adds, flyers etc.
- any research material (such as images, questionnaires)


Some elements which IRB review will discuss include

- Assessment if the study can't be done in another way - if participants are lied to, is there really no other way where that is not possible? Does it need to take 8 hours?
- Assessment is the study is worth it - if the benefits for the field are not significant, it might not get a pass (problems for replication studies)
- Assessment if the research is just - it benefits all people the same, not only a certain minority
- Assessment of research sample and possible misuse of power relationship - special protection of minorities, such as prisoners, children etc. Using prisoners for a prison related research is fine, selecting them for a study of visual acuity is probably bordering misuse of power.
- Assessment of no conflict of interest in studiet theme
