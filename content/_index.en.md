# Interesting Bits of Psychological science

I started this website to store all activities that I use during my lessons as well as to provide activities to teach IB Psychology - Free of charge. IB is cool and I believe it's goals are noble, yet the lack of support for their curriculum and charging people for everything, only providing licenses to those who pay etc. etc. goes against anything I believe open science and open education is. So this website allows you to have an alternative to paid resources and to provide guides for those who wanna teach or learn but don't want to or can't burn hundreds of dollars.

## Who is doing this?
I am teaching psychology at NOV√ù PORG in Prague, but only as a side job. I am a scientist at National Institute of Mental Health and Czech Academy of Sciences, focusing on VR, technologies and their psychological, behavioural and neural correlates. I have a bit of experience with teaching (IB) Psychology for few years, and I have experience with studying psychology and neurosciences from both Prague, Canada (McGill University) and the US (University of California, Davis). 

I don't consider what I write here as a necessary way to progress through the curriculum, but as a guideline that suits me and mine scientific background. You might find that I list things that IB either doesn't do at all or isn't keen on, but that is just my approach as a person, who has been doing psychology and psychological science for the past 10 years. 

## Helping things grow
