title = "5 percent can shape the world"
+++

This activity shows that social change doesn't have to be directed by masses or majority, but few goal oriented individuals can shape the stream of river of human aimlessness. Students get an instruction to walk freely and follow others, with a small percentage of them getting clear instructions of what to do - walk towards a basketball court, walk towards a door.

## Goal
Students learn that if everybody is somewhat aimless and without a particular agenda, few individuals can actually instruct majority in accepting their views, if that is done subversly.


## Structure
Print out the sheet and cut the instructions so that you have about 5 percent of instructions with a clear goal. Checkout the place where you can do this activity - gym outside court. You hsould have a fairly alrge place available. Not down the important place (door, statue, window) to which you will direct your chosen 5 percent. 

Finish the instructions so that the specifically say where to go. GO outside, give year student instructions at random. Explain how to walk slowly and how exactly to follow the common instructions. Spread each person around the court so that they are fairly away from each other. Start the thing :)

## Discussion
1. Hwo to relate results to real world - politics, social movements?
