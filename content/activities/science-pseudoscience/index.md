## Discussion

What makes a good science?
How do you decide if a topic is worth investigating or not?
Where does good and bad science differ?

## What makes good science?

1) Science follows rules and guidelines - appropriate at a certain point in scientific knowledge. When we know certain method is invalid, science stops using it. (Scientology )

2) Science values facts vs opinions - fact is a piece of information that multiple people agree on? Science is built on peer review and general rigorous falsification. You don't believe this? - Disprove it!

3) Science follows the principle of falsifiable hypotheses - hypotheses 

4) Science can be replicated

5) Science is build on proper theories - theories
