Synesthesia is not an unknown or entirely uncommon thing, but still. If an artist claims she sells paintings of what she hears, you'd better be certain before you buy it and start boasting to your friends.

## Goal
Design an experiment to prove synesthesia in an artist who claims so

## Structure

1. Show the video of an [artist with synesthsia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbh7tAnwLCY)
2. ASk students how would they go about proving or disproving the artist's claims
3. Try to play role of the artist and "debunk" all their tries.
4. Agree as a class on a foolproof way to test the hypothesis.
